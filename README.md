# Binary-Classifier-for-Unbalanced-data
In this project, we work with Credit Card Fraud Detection data, which is highly unbalanced.
We first do EDA including univariate and bivariate analysis.
We then do oversampling from the minority class to balance the data, and also standardize the features.
We next apply different ML models (Logist Regression, SVM, tree-based ensemble models), 
and compare their performance using a variety of metrics, 
to find a good classifier to predict fraudulent transactions.
